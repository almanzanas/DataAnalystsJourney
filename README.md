# Data Analyst's Journey 
This README is organized in descending order, so the newest, latest stuff I've immersed myself in is at the top. 

As the title of the repository implies, learning data science is a journey to explore with curiosity and an open mind. 

## Learning R
### Data Wrangling
Delving deeper into Data Science, this book explores data management, along with analytics and visualizations, ending with modeling ready for Machine Learning.<br>
Santos, G. R. (2023). *Data Wrangling with R: Load, Explore, Transform and Visualize Data for Modeling with Tidyverse Libraries*. Packt Publishing.

This time using R libraries for all the tasks necessary to perform a Data Science project including prediction and deployment. The libraries include `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `plotly`, `patchwork`, `skimr`, `statsr`, `corrplot`, `caret`, `randomForest`, and `ROCR`, among others.

### Base R
I have always considered it important to learn from the basics and thus consolidate knowledge.<br>
Buttrey, S. E., & Whitaker, L. R. (2017). *A Data Scientist’s Guide to Acquiring, Cleaning, and Managing Data in R*. John Wiley & Sons.

This book explains the whole process of a data scientist using Base-R only. It starts explaining everything you need to understand R, vectors, matrices, lists, data frames... as well as data types and how they work. It includes scripting and how to speed up the work using vectorization, compilation, and parallel processing.

## Learning Power BI
Following the steps in the book:<br>
Arnold, J. (2023). *Learning Microsoft Power Bi: Transforming Data Into Insights.* O’Reilly Media.

With a single dataset you go through all the stages necessary to make a meaningful dashboard. From importing and understanding the data to its deployment with PowerBI services, passing through data cleaning and transformation. In addition, as a highlight, it mentions and teaches multiple tools to work together with PowerBI which make our tasks more efficient.

## Learning Python
### Python Crash Course
In this repository you can find Notebooks with exercises and notes of the progress I have made in my Python learning, and Python for Data Analysis.<br>
Under [*pycrush_course*](https://github.com/almanzanas/DataAnalystsJourney/tree/main/pycrush_course) folder, I followed the loead of:<br>
Matthes, E. (2023). *Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition*. No Starch Press.

The book is composed of two parts, after completing the first part of more basic concepts of Python programming I wanted to focus on data and its visualization.<br>
The chapters corresponding to the second part of projects are:<br>
- Chapter 15: Generating Data
- Chapter 16: Downloading Data
- Chapter 17: Working with APIs

**Generating Data** (pycrush_course/generating_data.ipynb): A path through generating visualizations for random data, learning Matplotlib and Plotly mainly.

**Downloading Data** (pycrush_course/downloading_data.ipynb): After downloading csv and json files, generate suitable visualizations for them, e.g. Plotly visualization of maps to locate active fires or compare temperatures and rainfall over time in different locations.

**Working With APIs** (pycrush_course/working_with_apis.ipynb): This time, instead of downloading the data files from their source, we access them directly through their API and use the data to generate visualizations.

### Python for Data Analysis

Further, under the [*python_data_analysis/basics*](https://github.com/almanzanas/DataAnalystsJourney/tree/main/python_data_analysis/basics) folder you can find my progress with:
McKinney, W. (2022). *Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and Jupyter*. O’Reilly Media.

- Numpy Arrays and Vectorized Computation
- Pandas
- Working with Data Files
- Data Cleaning and Data Preparation
- Data Wrangling
- Plotting Visualizations (matplotlib, pandas & seaborn)
- Data Aggregation and Group Operations

In the [*python_data_analysis/da_practice*](https://github.com/almanzanas/DataAnalystsJourney/tree/main/python_data_analysis/da_practice) folder is the more complete exercise tracker involving all the content of the book:
- [baby_names](https://github.com/almanzanas/DataAnalystsJourney/blob/main/python_data_analysis/da_practice/notebooks/baby_names.ipynb): exploration of data related to the name given to newborns from 1880 to 2010 and how some of the names have evolved.
