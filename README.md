# PyCrash. Learning Python

In this repository you can find Notebooks with exercises and notes of the progress I have made in my Python learning.<br>
All this has been possible thanks to:<br>
Matthes, E. (2023). *Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition*. No Starch Press.

The book is composed of two parts, after completing the first part of more basic concepts of Python programming I wanted to focus on data and its visualization.<br>
The chapters corresponding to the second part of projects are:<br>
- Chapter 15: Generating Data
- Chapter 16: Downloading Data
- Chapter 17: Working with APIs

**Generating Data** (data_visualization/generating_data.ipynb): A path through generating visualizations for random data, learning Matplotlib and Plotly mainly.

**Downloading Data** (data_visualization/downloading_data.ipynb): After downloading csv and json files, generate suitable visualizations for them, e.g. Plotly visualization of maps to locate active fires or compare temperatures and rainfall over time in different locations.

**Working With APIs** (data_visualization/working_with_apis.ipynb): This time, instead of downloading the data files from their source, we access them directly through their API and use the data to generate visualizations.
