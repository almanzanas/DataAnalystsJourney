# Data Analyst's Journey 
## Learning Python
### Python Crash Course
In this repository you can find Notebooks with exercises and notes of the progress I have made in my Python learning, and Python for Data Analysis.<br>
Under [*pycrush_course*](https://github.com/almanzanas/DataAnalystsJourney/tree/main/pycrush_course) folder, I followed the loead of:<br>
Matthes, E. (2023). *Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition*. No Starch Press.

The book is composed of two parts, after completing the first part of more basic concepts of Python programming I wanted to focus on data and its visualization.<br>
The chapters corresponding to the second part of projects are:<br>
- Chapter 15: Generating Data
- Chapter 16: Downloading Data
- Chapter 17: Working with APIs

**Generating Data** (pycrush_course/generating_data.ipynb): A path through generating visualizations for random data, learning Matplotlib and Plotly mainly.

**Downloading Data** (pycrush_course/downloading_data.ipynb): After downloading csv and json files, generate suitable visualizations for them, e.g. Plotly visualization of maps to locate active fires or compare temperatures and rainfall over time in different locations.

**Working With APIs** (pycrush_course/working_with_apis.ipynb): This time, instead of downloading the data files from their source, we access them directly through their API and use the data to generate visualizations.

### Python for Data Analysis

Further, under the [*python_data_analysis/basics*](https://github.com/almanzanas/DataAnalystsJourney/tree/main/python_data_analysis/basics) folder you can find my progress with:
McKinney, W. (2022). *Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and Jupyter*. Oâ€™Reilly Media.

- Numpy Arrays and Vectorized Computation
- Pandas
- Working with Data Files
- Data Cleaning and Data Preparation
- Data Wrangling
- Plotting Visualizations (matplotlib, pandas & seaborn)
- Data Aggregation and Group Operations

In the [*python_data_analysis/da_practice*](https://github.com/almanzanas/DataAnalystsJourney/tree/main/python_data_analysis/da_practice) folder is the more complete exercise tracker involving all the content of the book:
- [baby_names](https://github.com/almanzanas/DataAnalystsJourney/blob/main/python_data_analysis/da_practice/notebooks/baby_names.ipynb): exploration of data related to the name given to newborns from 1880 to 2010 and how some of the names have evolved.
